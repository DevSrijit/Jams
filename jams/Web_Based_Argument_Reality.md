# Build Web-based Augmented Reality

### Details:

**_Outcome:_** Build an interactive web-based Augmented Reality (AR) application featuring a customizable 3D model in under an hour.

**_Requirements:_** Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No prior experience with AR, 3D modeling, or external libraries required. Beginner friendly.

**_Language Used:_** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with AR.js and A-Frame libraries.

**_Customization Opportunity_** Club members can customize their AR application by choosing or creating their own 3D models, customizing the AR scene, and even incorporating interactive elements.

**_Platform Limitations:_** This project will work in any modern browser, making it accessible across all devices including mobile.



**_Time Estimation:_** 60 minutes.

### Breakdown:

- **_Set Up:_** Fork the provided starter project on Repl.it (5 minutes)
<br>

- **_Part 1:_** Introduction to AR, AR.js, and A-Frame libraries. Discussion of AR's potential applications and benefits (10 minutes)
<br>

- **_Part 2:_** Setting up a basic HTML page and including the necessary libraries. Starting the AR scene setup using the A-Frame library (15 minutes)
<br>

- **_Part 3:_** Choosing or creating a 3D model. Discussing file types and how to incorporate the 3D model into the AR scene (15 minutes)
<br>

- **_Part 4:_** Viewing the AR scene through the device's camera. Interaction with the 3D model in the AR scene (10 minutes)
<br>

- **_VOLAA!!!_** You've just built your first web-based AR app and brought a 3D model to life in an interactive scene (5 minutes)!

**Make sure your proposal answer these questions about your Jam idea:**

- **Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?**
    - AR is an exciting, rapidly evolving field with numerous applications in industries ranging from gaming to healthcare. Creating an AR application is an interesting, fun, and relevant project that also equips students with valuable skills and knowledge in an innovative field.
<br>

- **General outline of a club meet doing the Jam**
  - **5 minutes:** Quick introduction to AR and its applications
  - **40 minutes:** Detailed walkthrough of the project steps with live coding
  - **10 minutes:** Independent work, customization, and problem-solving time
  - **5 minutes:** Show and tell: opportunity for club members to showcase their AR applications
<br>

- **What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)**
  - Club members will gain an understanding of AR, its potential, and its implementation using JavaScript libraries. They will walk away with a personalized, interactive, and web-based AR application that can serve as a springboard for more complex AR projects.
<br>

- **What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?**
  - The hands-on nature of the workshop, the interactive and visual elements, and the opportunity to bring their chosen 3D models to life in an AR scene will make this a unique, engaging, and fun experience for club members.
<br>

- **What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?**
    - This project will be supported on all devices that have a modern browser, including Windows, MacOS, Chromebooks, and mobile devices.
<br>

- **How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?**
    - The flexible nature of this Jam allows club leaders to incorporate their own touch by choosing unique 3D models, designing the AR scene, adding interactive elements, and even extending the project with more advanced features, if desired.

### Challenges & Extensions:

- **To make the project more challenging, club members can:**
    - Create and incorporate their own 3D models
    - Add interactivity (e.g., the model moves or changes when clicked)
    - Integrate multiple models into the AR scene
    - Extend the project with more advanced features
<br>

##### I am eager to guide this Jam and can't wait to see the creative AR applications that club members will develop!
