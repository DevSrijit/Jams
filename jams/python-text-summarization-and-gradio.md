# Text Summarization in Python, Deploying the Model with Gradio

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Create a fully functional text summarization web-application from scratch using Python and Gradio. Anyone can use the model you create using 

_Requirements:_ Google Colab Access (comes free with Google/Gmail account)

_Language used:_ Python

_Customization opportunity:_ We'll cover one method of using Python for text summarization (which doesn't technically involve machine learning), but there are many other methods that can be used (including machine learning). Additionally, you can customize the Gradio web app to show different metrics about the text you want summarized (like word count, character count, sentence count, etc), in addition to the summary.

_Platform Limitations:_ Browser based Google Colab, so available on all platforms.

_Time estimation:_ 55 mins (created a video workshop about this same topic, and it was 53 minutes)

### Breakdown
- Part 0: slides that cover the basics of natural language processing (how computers understand human language) and different approaches to text summarization (in an intuitive way)
- Part 1: Get everyone onto Google Colab
- Part 2: Code out the Python text summarization function (input is text, returns summary)
- Part 3: Deploy this using Gradio (is only a couple lines of code, hooray!)
- Part 4: Customize the model/Gradio web app to your liking
- Hooray!!! Now you've got a text summarization web app!
