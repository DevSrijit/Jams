# Close Call - a simple 3d game in Unity

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Create your own 3D whack-a-mole-style game in Unity.  Readers will learn some of the basic fundamentals of Unity as well as more intermediate/advanced concepts as the series progresses.  The resulting game can be compiled to run on iOS, Android, HTML5, or native Windows/OSX/Linux.

_Requirements:_ Unity 2022.3.3f1+ (latest LTS)

_Language used:_ C#

_Customization opportunity:_ There will be several prompted opportunities for people following the jam to modify the game logic & aesthetics to make the game "theirs".  There will also be some suggestions/prompts at the end of the series of potential features that could be implemented, and which would be left to the reader.

_Platform Limitations:_ Requires machines capable of running the Unity Editor (not suitable for Chromebooks).  Windows/OSX/Linux supported.

_Time estimation:_ 5 Hours

### Breakdown

- Jam 1: Unity installation, project setup, asset gathering, basic environment setup
  - Readers will be prompted to use their own different assets for their game
- Jam 2: Prefab creation, script setup, spawning cute critters (and dropping anvils on them)
  - Readers will be prompted to explore physics settings
- Jam 3: Adding game logic, UI, and click handling
  - Readers will be prompted to tweak specific game logic to suit their own tastes
- Jam 4: Polish (squashing things, splats, floating text feedback, adding sound)
  - Readers will be encouraged to use their own sounds and text
- Jam 5: More polish (post-processing, camera-shake, misc loose ends)
  - Readers will be encouraged to explore different the various post-processing effects that can be applied to the camera to achieve different styles

### Notes
All of these jams will come a separate starting-point directory that participants can potentially use to skip to specific topics that interest them, or alternatively to catch up to the rest of the club, for instance in cases where someone misses a week.
