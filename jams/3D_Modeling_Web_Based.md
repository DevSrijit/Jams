# 3D Modeling: Making Hardware to Complement Your Software

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Learn to 3D Model with TinkerCAD

_Requirements:_ Computer that has Internet access (TinkerCAD), a working mouse. Maybe an Autodesk account

_Language used:_ N/A

_Customization opportunity:_ Make any 3D model project after learning the basics, whether you want it to look beautiful, function perfectly, or both!

_Platform Limitations:_ be good enough to run a browser, and actually have a keyboard (be a computer not a mobile device) and is able to use a mouse

_Time estimation:_ ~1 Hour

### Breakdown
TinkerCAD
- Set up: Login to Tinkercad
- Part 1: Learn to make basic shapes from the sidebar, and how to model them
- Part 2: Learn to align combine, and cut shapes
- Part 3: Learn to import and export

**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? 
----- They can choose what they model

- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
----- I believe that knowing 3D modeling can be a great help to people wishing to bring programs out of just their computer and into the real world

- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
----- Knowledge: the basics of 3D modeling, and knowledge about how to use a basic 3D modeling product
----- Product: an item that they modeled themselves

- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
----- It's an unprecedented hardware project as opposed to the abundance of software projects

- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
----- Any computer (not mobile) that can run TinkerCAD

- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
----- They can choose what to model
