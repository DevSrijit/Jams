# 3D Modeling: Making Hardware to Complement Your Software

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Learn to 3D Model with TinkerCAD

_Requirements:_ Computer that has Internet access (TinkerCAD), a working mouse. Maybe an Autodesk account

_Language used:_ N/A

_Customization opportunity:_ Make any 3D model project after learning the basics, whether you want it to look beautiful, function perfectly, or both!

_Platform Limitations:_ be good enough to run a browser, and actually have a keyboard (be a computer not a mobile device) and is able to use a mouse

_Time estimation:_ Setup 20m at most, part 0 10~30m, part 1 20~40m, part 2 20~40m, part 3 10~15m
 (Times for part 0, 1, and 2 vary depending on what object you try to create)

### Breakdown
TinkerCAD
- Set up: Login to Tinkercad
- Part 0: Learn to view items like a 3D modeler in basic shapes
- Part 1: Learn to make basic shapes from the sidebar, and how to model them
- Part 2: Learn to align, combine, and cut shapes
- Part 3: Learn to import and export

**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? 
----- They can choose the object that they model.

- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
----- I believe that knowing 3D modeling can be a great help to people wishing to bring programs out of just their computer and into the real world. Also, it can allow more familiarity with 3D workspaces if people wish to create things like 3D games. It even allows them to create basic assets for it.
----- Also, TinkerCAD is a great way to enter the 3D modeling space, and it's easy to apply skills learned through rigorous TinkerCAD use to more professional programs like Blender and Fusion

- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
----- Knowledge: the basics of 3D modeling, how to view items in the lens of 3D building blocks, and knowledge about how to use a basic 3D modeling program. 
----- Product: an item that they modeled themselves, whether it is to be printed out, saved on the computer, or used as an asset in a game.

- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
----- It's an unprecedented hardware project as opposed to the abundance of software projects. Also, it's a very good helper project that builds 3D visualization skills.

- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
----- Any computer (not mobile) that can run TinkerCAD. As far as I know it just requires access to https://www.tinkercad.com/

- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
----- They can choose what to model and how to begin building their skills.
