# Let's build a game!!

This Jam will walk Hack Clubbers through creating a game with [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/).

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Build your own web-based game and share it with all your friends!

_Requirements:_ A device with a web browser, access to glitch.com (and optionally piskel.app)

_Language used:_ JavaScript

_Customization opportunity:_ Jammers will be able to customize basically every aspect of their game, from the sprites to the levels to the music.

_Platform Limitations:_ Browser-based development with glitch.com, so it works on any desktop browser.

_Time estimation:_ 30 minutes to 1 hour 

### Breakdown
- Set up: Make an account on glitch.com (5 minutes)
- Part 1: Remix a template I will make (<5 minutes)
- Part 2: Fill in the blanks in the template (like the Sprig template) (15-20 min)
- Part 3: Explain + demo creating levels (15 min)
- Part 4 (optional): Demonstrate creating sprites with piskel.app (15 min)
- Show people how to get a public link to a Glitch project (2 min)
- Let the Jammers go wild for the rest of the workshop time!

### Questions
#### How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? 
I will not say that This Is The Level/Sprite You Should Create, and show multiple examples. 
#### Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
It gives them a fun way to get some JS experience, and it gives them something to show off as well.
1. What are we going to make?
2. Get started on Glitch
3. Look at the basic code structure
4. Add some stuff (filling in blanks) + talk about Kaboom docs
5. Demo level structure
6. (optional) how to make a pixel-art sprite
7. Play each other's games!
#### What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
- How to use Glitch to quickly make a web app
- How to use Kaboom to make a game
- How to use basic JS
- A fun game that they can share with their friends!
#### What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
- Everyone's played games before, now it's time for them to make one!
#### What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
[Any device with a modern browser](https://help.glitch.com/hc/en-us/articles/16287569360397-What-are-the-supported-browsers-for-Glitch-), but desktop/laptop is preferred
#### How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
They can demo a game they have already made at the start, to say "hey, this is what you can make!"
