# Build Your own-globe: Synthesizing a reactive and custom snowglobe!

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Create your virtual snow globe that reflect who you are and that reacts to touch and motion

_Requirements:_ Computer + IDE (Required, for coding. Replit is also acceptable), Internet Access (Required, for downloading assets), Github (Optional, for deployment), Mobile Device (Optional, for motion sensing)

_Language used:_ A-Frame

_Customization opportunity:_ Scan any object, person, or room you'd like and create your own A-Frame world around that object. You could also include multiple objects/people/rooms. Each world created is different and can have a level of complexity decided by the Jammer. 

_Platform Limitations:_ There is no platform limitation for the coding part of the project. However, due to an API limitation, the motion reaction is only available on devices with a gyroscope running one of the supported platforms. [See MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gyroscope).

_Time estimation:_ 1 Hour 

### Breakdown
- Set up: Make sure everyone has an IDE ready to go. (Hint: Glitch.com provides an easy interface if members need a quick and easy solution for begginners!), download boilerplate code. (5 minutes)
- Part 1: Getting assets: setting up your globe with a world and particles  (10-15 minutes)
- Part 2: Pretentious Particles: Customizing how the particles act and interat (15 minutes)
- Part 3: Rumble it up: Adding touch and motion interactions to the snowglobe (5 minutes)
- Part 4: The Snow Goes On: making your snowglobe yours and adding the finishing touches, deploying to Github pages (15 minutes)
- Part 5: Snow and Tell: (_Optional_) show off your snow globes!



**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? 
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
- General outline of a club meet doing the Jam
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
