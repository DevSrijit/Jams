# Build Your Virtual "Own Globe": Synthesizing a reactive and custom snow globe!

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Create your virtual snow globe that reflect who you are and that reacts to touch and motion

_Requirements:_ Computer + IDE (Required, for coding. Replit is also acceptable), Internet Access (Required, for downloading assets), GitHub (Optional, for deployment), Mobile Device (Optional, for motion sensing)

_Language used:_ HTML/JS/CSS

_Customization opportunity:_ Change up the way your snow globe looks, what's precipitating, or even how the particles interact!

_Platform Limitations:_ There is no platform limitation for the coding part of the project. However, due to an API limitation, the motion reaction is only available on devices with a gyroscope running one of the supported platforms. [See MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gyroscope).

_Time estimation:_ 1 Hour 

### Breakdown
- Set up: Make sure everyone has an IDE ready to go. (Hint: Glitch.com provides an easy interface if members need a quick and easy solution for beginners!), download boilerplate code. (5 minutes)
- Part 1: Getting assets: setting up your globe with a world and particles  (10-15 minutes)
- Part 2: Pretentious Particles: Customizing how the particles act and interact (15 minutes)
- Part 3: Rumble it up: Adding touch and motion interactions to the snow globe (5 minutes)
- Part 4: The Snow Goes On: making your snow globe yours and adding the finishing touches, deploying to GitHub pages (15 minutes) (P.S. I will be creating a snow globe gallery online!)
- Part 5: Snow and Tell: (_Optional_) show off your snow globes!

### About the Jam
  This jam is meant to give clubbers and newbies alike the chance to create something unique to them, while still preserving the "wow factor." The project is simple enough to follow along with, but open-ended enough to allow participants to create something akin to their knowledge level. Also, snow globes ❄️ are just fun! Participants will walk away with their own snow globe online! Club leaders can build along with the presentation and use their snow globe as an example. Personally, I want to build this jam to run as a program at my library to attract people to Tulsa Hack Club! I can't wait to see all the things people make!
