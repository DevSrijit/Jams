- Part 1: Add these inputs: trip destination, trip start date, trip end date (15 min)
- Part 2: Configure OpenAI API and get your API key (5 min)
- Part 3: Validate that all inputs are filled in (5 min)
- Part 4: Send a request to the OpenAI API, with a custom prompt including all the details. Make sure the repsonse comes back in JSON (20 min)

**Make sure your proposal answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
    - It employs a technique used is a very new and upcoming field. It also solves a very important problem that people have. Can be used almost anywhere and useful to everyone going on trips. 
- General outline of a club meet doing the Jam
    - Orient everyone with Replit
    - Walk through creating the `<input>` fields
    - Wait for questions, and emphasize that the next part is "when the fun starts"
    - Set up an API key and share with everyone (most students won't have billing set up, so it's best to set up a club API key and share that with members)
    - Brainstorm ideas for prompts with club members
    - Work through parsing the information that comes back (guide them through JSON.parse)
    - Implement a loading screen
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
    - New knowledge of how to build an application with ChatGPT and best practices for prompting
        - Different parameters included in the ChatGPT API (e.g. `temperature`, `diversity` )
    - Learn the behind-the-scenes technique for how popular apps actually use ChatGPT to specialize it for their use
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
    - For many this will be the first time they use ChatGPT, and it will be very exciting to walk away with something that is useful and important.
    - The sheer power of ChatGPT and how knowledgeable it is about different places is astounding
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
    - All, done in browser with Replit by default (if they want to do it locally, that's also an option)
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
    - Customization: customize what kind of vacation would be best for you, non-touristy, food related, etc. etc. and customize the loading screen
    - Modify the workshop to include only attractions, only parks
    - Changing the scope from a global thing to just in a city (i.e. only in San Francisco)
