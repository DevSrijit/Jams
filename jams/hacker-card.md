# Hacker Card -- Design Your First PCB

It'll be very similar to the [workshop call](https://github.com/hackclub/OnBoard/blob/main/meta/2023-05-20_WORKSHOP_CALL.md) I ran for OnBoard!

### Details:

_Outcome:_ Design your own PCB Business Card that supports NFC! Club members can also get the design (or other PCB designs) fabricated through [OnBoard](https://github.com/hackclub/onboard)

_Requirements:_ Access to [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com)

_Software used:_ EasyEDA

_Customization opportunity:_ Use different components on the PCB card (different colored LEDs, etc.); also customize the silkscreen designs on the PCB, or even the shape. It's also not necessary to make it a business card, so jammers could create keychains, badges, or other items instead!

_Platform limitations:_ Browser based PCB designer, so it's available on all platforms

_Time estimation:_ 1 hour

### Breakdown
- Set up: Go to EasyEDA and create a new project
- Part 1: Designing the schematic
  - Explain what a PCB is and the basic circuitry of how the card works
  - Introduce the [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) parts library, the parts picker, and the different tools on the schematic designer
- Part 2: Designing the PCB
  - Place the components on the board and use autorouter + manual routing to route
  - Customize with silkscreen, soldermask layers, custom board outlines and cutouts
  - Jammers can add their own art, their own name to the card, social links, a QR code, and more!
- Success! You've designed a PCB that you can now have manufactured via OnBoard and JLCPCB! And through this introduction to PCB design, jammers will learn how PCB design works, so that they can create more complex projects on their own.
