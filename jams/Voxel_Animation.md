# Create your own 3D voxel animation scene
  
 ### Details: 
 _Outcome:_ Create your own unique blender like animation with the power of voxels, JavaScript and Three.js, that remind you of those minecraft animations that you watched as a child. This jam is different to other animations workshops because it focuses more on world and story design because there is a restriction to only use Voxels. Further more the every member will need to create their **own** scene that will be animated and created from **scratch**.
  
 _Requirements:_ Replit Access and basic JavaScript knowledge 
  
 _Language used:_ JavaScript 
  
 _Customization opportunity:_ Create your own voxel based, blender like animation. You are able to customize the camera motion and even each individual voxel to create your dream animation. Each voxel can be customized with different colors and even textures making each voxel unique!
  
 _Platform Limitations:_ Browser-based Replit Development, so available on all platforms
  
 _Time estimation:_ 1 Hour  
  
 ### Breakdown 
 - Set up: Fork a replit starter with necessary materials 
 - Part 1: Create a `Play` button so you can play the animation.
 - Part 2: Implement a basic renderer using ThreeJS
 - Part 3: Add the functionality for the animation to be recorded 
 - Part 4: Create the map that the animation will live in
 - Success!!! Now you've got an animation.
  
 **Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:** 
 - How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)?  
 Every animation should physically be impossible to be replicated unknowingly. As such every jammer will have their own unique and lovely animation. See Customization opportunity section.
 - Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project? 
 Hack Clubbers should care about this project because it gives them JavaScript experience in a lovely and fun way. Moreover it gives them an entry to the world of game development and animation that is currently seeing a rapid increase.
 - General outline of a club meet doing the Jam 
    + The club leader will show initial setup
    + The club leader will showcase how to add the play button, record, renderer functionality
    + Each member will create their own scene and animation.
    + The club leader uploads their animations to the gallery
 - What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
 Club members will walk away with a better understanding of JavaScript and 3D space in general.
 - What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members? 
 This workshop will be fun, interesting and exciting for all Club members because they will have fun coding unique animations. Moreover they will gain insight to the exciting world of Game development and 3D Animations.
 - What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)? 
 All platforms that support replit will be supported but Desktop is preferred.
 - How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
 I will create a gallery of animations that all leaders will be able to submit their members animations.
