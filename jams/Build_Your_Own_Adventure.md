# Build Your Own Adventure Game!
Whether you have programmed your whole life or this is your very first project, there is plenty of fun to be had with creating a Choose Your Own Adventure Game! 
This build incorporates music, interactive elements, and the ability to control all stylistic features!
The most important part is to use your imagination since there is no limit to what YOU can create! 
No matter what difficulty you choose, you will have a playable game fit to share with family, and friends, and publish! 
You will gain invaluable knowledge in Python or Java which you can use to create more games or implement in other projects!

Club leaders can create their versions to share, give a quick overview of the basics of whichever language they choose to complete the project in, create themes and or challenges for club members, and can tweak the difficulty of the project to what they see fit. 

## Details:

Create a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Game, either text-based or GUI!

The sky is the limit with this build allowing jammers to use their imagination to create epic results!

### Platform Limitations: 
Browser-based Replit Development, so available on all platforms (+ App available on both iOS and Android)

### Time estimation: 
45 Minutes (Depends on how detailed the jammer wants their build to be)

## Breakdown
Set up: Fork either the Java or Python replit starter with the necessary materials
### Part 1: (ETC: Simplest and can be completed in under 30 minutes)
Follow the instructions and start building a text-based Java or Python Adventure Game
          - Plan out your game by creating characters, storyline, and options

Success!!! You now have a working text-based Choose your own adventure game! 

### Part 2: (ETC: Increased in difficulty and can take up to 1 hour)
The game is working well and you would like some music in the background to add to your game's theme
          - Add premade music or create your own, and you may be able to change the music played depending on which section the player is at of their adventure. 

Success!!! Now you have an upgraded version of your text-based game. How about we take things to the next level?

### Part 3: (ETC: May take several hours/club meets to complete)
At this point, you may want to graduate from text-based to the user interface. Here you will create interactive buttons, and backgrounds, allowing you to have full control over your game stylistically. 

Success!!! Now you have a fully interactive Choose Your Own Adventure Game!
