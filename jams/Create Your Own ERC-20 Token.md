# Create Your Own Ethereum ERC-20 Token!

### Details:
_Outcome:_ By the end of this jam, you will be able to - 
1. Create your own ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain in a testnet (not published due to restrictions)
2. Learn about the Ethereum network

_Requirements:_ A stable web browser that runs Remix IDE, Metamask (A place to interact and store your coin) and Quicknode (to create a Testnet) 

_Language used:_ Solidity (an object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms)

_Customization opportunity:_ Create you own coin with custom names, custom symbols, custom coin limits

_Platform Limitations:_ Browser-based, so available on all platforms

_Time estimation:_ 1 Hour or less 

### Breakdown
- Set up: Understand the ethereum network
- Understanding Solidity: going to start by explaining the code, showing some examples and going through the example code line by line to ensure that the code is easy to follow.
- Part 1: Set up a Metamask and Quicknode account (takes from 10 to 15 mins)
- Part 2: Open remix IDE and write solidity code (its super easy that you can do it under 15 lines of code or less!) (takes from 20 to half an hour)
- Part 3: Deploy the token and verify its existence! (5 mins max!)
- Tada!!! You have now made an Token to flex to other with! 

**Q & A:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)?
### -  Each token is unique in its own way with custom names, symbols, and icons, giving a unique feel. The systems of each project, such as the blockchains they work on, contracts they use, and code they write, are fairly easy to change. The Ethereum blockchain is just an example, members can easily make their coin on any other chain like MATIC or BNB, allowing for further customization and uniqueness.
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
### - Hack Clubbers can use the coins they make for personal purposes. For example, they can reward their friends for something they helped with using a coin they made. These coins are shareable as long as they are in the same testnet as the receiver. While these coins may not have significant monetary value, they can be used as a sign of gratitude or as a way to learn about managing personal finances. Additionally, by learning about current technologies like cryptocurrency and FinTech, Hack Clubbers can stay up to date with current trends and gain practical knowledge.
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
### - Club members will be able to learn a new language called Solidity and gain experience with creating an Ethereum token. They will have hands-on experience in writing Solidity code, deploying tokens on a testnet, and use them. While the tokens created during the workshop may not have real-world value, members will gain knowledge about blockchain technology, smart contracts, and the basics of creating their own tokens.
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
### - The ability to create something unique that can be shared with others and used practically adds an element of fun to the workshop. Club members can customize their tokens with names, symbols, and icons, giving them a sense of creativity and ownership over their projects. Additionally, learning about cryptocurrency and exploring the Ethereum network can be exciting for those interested in blockchain technology and its applications.
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
### - This project would work as long you have a stable computer browser in any device other than a mobile (It will work but its very unstable and might end up buggy) 
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
### - Club Leaders will be able to make their own projects and share them with their community. Like mentioned, these coins can be shared within the testnet so that the leaders can present and use them within the club. Leaders can then use these coins as a way to reward eachother or for any thing they wish. This enables a sense of ownership in their meetings.
