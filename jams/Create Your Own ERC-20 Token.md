# Create Your Own Ethereum ERC-20 Token!

### Details:
_Outcome:_ By the end of this jam, you will be able to - 
1. Create your own ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain in a testnet (not published due to restrictions)
2. Learn about the Ethereum network

_Requirements:_ A stable web browser that runs Remix IDE, Metamask (A place to interact and store your coin) and Quicknode (to create a Testnet) 

_Language used:_ Solidity (an object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms)

_Customization opportunity:_ Create you own coin with custom names, custom symbols, custom coin limits

_Platform Limitations:_ Browser-based, so available on all platforms

_Time estimation:_ 1 Hour or less 

### Breakdown
- Set up: Understand the ethereum network
- Part 1: Set up a Metamask and Quicknode account
- Part 2: Open remix IDE and write solidity code (its super easy that you can do it under 15 lines of code or less!)
- Part 3: Deploy the token and verify its existence!
- Tada!!! You have now made an Token to flex to other with! 

**Q & A:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)?
### -  Each token is unique in its own way with custom names and symbols and icons giving an unique feel.
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
### - As the world progresses we are moving in a faster pace towards cryptocurrency and FinTech, by learning about current technologies Hackclubbers can be up to date with current trends.
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
### - Club members will be able to learn a new language called Solidity and gain experience on the ethereum token. While the token isnt in the mainnet it gives an idea on how crypto works.
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
### - Learning something new which is in your intrests always can turn out fun as by making something new you learn something new.  
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
### - This project would work as long you have a stable computer browser in any device other than a mobile (It will work but its very unstable and might end up buggy) 
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
### - As mentioned making your crypto is very customizable giving a sense of ownership.
