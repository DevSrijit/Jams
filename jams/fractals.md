# WebGL Shaders: Drawing fractals with JavaScript

### Details:
* __Outcome__: Build your very own fractal renderer capable of drawing and zooming into fractals in *real time*
* __Requirements__: Any computer with a text editor and browser
* __Language Used__: HTML, Javascript, GLSL
* __Customization opportunity__: There are hundreds of different types of fractals that can be implemented in the Jam, and people can add their own colors and gradients to the app
* __Time Estimation__: 1 Hour

### Overview
1) Learn about the imaginary plane and how fractals are formed (Mathematical Overview)
2) Here you can choose a specific fractal to use for your project
3) What is WebGL, and why are we using it instead of just Javascript and Canvas elements?
4) Rendering fractals
    1) Setting up WebGL code
    3) What are Vertex and Fragment Shaders
    2) Drawing a square
    3) Rendering our scene
    4) Uniform variables
    5) Simplifying the complex plane to real numbers
    6) Adding color
    7) Camera controls
5) Where to go from here, further optimizations like perturbation theory, and trade offs from using GPU
