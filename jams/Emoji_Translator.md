**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? 
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
- General outline of a club meet doing the Jam
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
