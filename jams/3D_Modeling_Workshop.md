# 3D Modeling: Making Hardware to Complement Your Software

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Learn to 3D Model first with TinkerCAD, then Blender, and finally, AutoDesk Fusion 360

_Requirements:_ Computer that has Internet access (TinkerCAD), able to install Blender and Fusion 360. Also a working mouse.

_NOTE:_ TinkerCAD is free and online. Blender is free and open source. Fusion is not free, but some schools (most private schools I believe) have student access. It is pretty expensive though ($495 when writing this) but people can just choose to learn the other two programs. It's also fine if we scale down this Jam to only one program.

_Language used:_ N/A

_Customization opportunity:_ Make any 3D model project after learning the basics, whether you want it to look beautiful, function perfectly, or both!

_Platform Limitations:_ need install for Blender and Fusion if choosing to learn them

_Time estimation:_ 0.5-2 Hour each program

### Breakdown

- Part 3: Learn to import and export

Blender
- Set up: Install Blender and log in
- Part 1: Learn to make basic shapes from presets
- Part 2: Learn to use the modeling tab and interact with vertices
- Part 3: Learn to use the sculpting tab

Fusion
- Set up: Install Fusion and log in
- Part 1: Learn Fusion's organization system
- Part 2: Learn to make sketches
- Part 3: Learn to extrude, bevel, rotate, loft, cut, and fuse
- Part 4: Learn to set up offset planes for sketching

**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? 
----- They can choose what they model

- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
----- I believe that knowing 3D modeling can be a great help to people wishing to bring programs out of just their computer and into the real world

- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
----- Knowledge: How to use three of the most used 3D modeling programs. 
----- Product: an item that they modeled themselves

- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
----- It's an unprecedented hardware project as opposed to the abundance of software projects

- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
----- Any computer that can run these 3D modeling programs

- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
----- They can choose what to model
