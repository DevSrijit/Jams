# Jams ü´êüçìüçá
Teaching coding is hard. Running engaging Hack Club meetings is even harder. By September we want to create a repository of the most incredible coding projects ever! This summer you can build the future of Hack Club workshops - we're calling them Jams!

Work with the team at HQ to contribute a jam and **we'll pay you $200** for it. it'll be used by thousands of Hack Clubbers around the world!

### What is a Jam?

The goal is to build a highly curated list of quality projects for varying technical abilities. The content is high quality, slides, videos within a beautiful page that's easy to filter... They're real projects that can be completed in under 1 hour, are very visual, and have clear paths for continued hacking. Members should be inspired to keep hacking on the project after the session, not left feeling stuck without knowing what to do next. Everyone's result is different

*We expect that this process will require your 10-15hour time commitment*

** example?

### Here's how to get started:
*We're only accepting 20 Jams in this round*
1. Propose a Jam by making a pull request to this folder, following this [file format](/). Here's a list of Jams that we are looking for, but feel free to submit other ideas too!
3. Hear back from the team within 48 hours Mon-Fri on whether your proposal is accepted.
4. Once accepted, work with the team to write the Jam, make a presentation and film a short video by XYZ.
5. Kaching!

**Submission requirements:**

### List of Jam topics:
* 

- You must be a club leader or an active community member in order to submit a workshop.
- Your Jam can be original or a remix of an existing workshop with clear improvements.
- Your Jam must propose a compelling, specific, real project, using real code. **It should not be a tutorial** for a language or service. It should also not be a series of small projects with no clear ending or final product.
  - ‚úÖ [Animated 3D Models](https://workshops.hackclub.com/3d_models_with_zdog/), which uses a simple JavaScript library to create awesome-looking 3D models
  - ‚ùå A tutorial for how to get started with AWS
  - ‚ùå A workshop on an introduction to Scratch
- Your Jam must be able to be completed in under 1 hour, but it should be very easy for people to continue hacking on it.
- Your Jam must involve code, and not require desktop software or hardware, since not all clubs will have those resources.
  - ‚úÖ A Python workshop where the first step is to start a new Python project at [repl.it/languages/python](https://repl.it/languages/python)
  - ‚ùå A workshop on making an Android app that requires installing Android Studio
- Your Jam must be in English at native-level proficiency. 


**Wrapping up:**

This is a change to how we've done this before. This is not a large-scale thing. If you're accepted, you'll work with a team to develope high quality content that clubs and individuals will use every day.

If you have any questions, please message in [#jams]() on Slack. I'll be hanging out there to help out.
