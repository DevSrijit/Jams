# Jams ü´êüçìüçá
Teaching coding is hard. Running engaging Hack Club meetings is even harder. That's why, by September, we want to create an all-new repository of the most incredible coding projects ever! 

**This summer join us to build the future of Hack Club workshops - we're calling them Jams!**

You can work with the team at HQ to ship a Jam and **we'll pay you $200** for your 10-15 hour time commitment. Then, your Jam will be used by thousands of Hack Clubbers around the world!

### What is a Jam?

It's a real project that can be completed in under 1 hour, is very visual, and has clear paths for continued hacking. Everyone's result is different and it encourages real learning, not just copying and pasting! The goal is to build a quality project for varying technical abilities and will include slides and a video. 

** example?

### Here's how to get started:
*NOTE: We're only accepting 20 Jams in this round*
1. Propose a Jam by making a pull request to [this folder](/jams), following this [format](/jams/example.md). Below is the list of Jams that we're looking for, but feel free to submit other ideas too!
3. Hear back from the team within 48 hours Mon-Fri on whether your proposal is accepted.
4. Once accepted, work closely with the team to write the Jam, make a presentation and film a short video by July 19.
5. Ka-chingüí∞ü™ô!

** List of Jam topics:**
- 

**Submission requirements:**
- You must be a club leader or an active community member in order to submit a Jam.
- Your Jam can be original or a remix of an existing workshop, but must have clear improvements.
- Your Jam must propose a compelling, specific, real project, using real code. **It should not be a tutorial** for a language or service. It should also not be a series of small projects with no clear ending or final product.
  - ‚úÖ [Animated 3D Models](https://workshops.hackclub.com/3d_models_with_zdog/), which uses a simple JavaScript library to create awesome-looking 3D models
  - ‚ùå A tutorial for how to get started with AWS
  - ‚ùå A workshop on an introduction to Scratch
- Your Jam must be able to be completed in under 1 hour, but it should be very easy for people to continue hacking on it.
- Your Jam must involve code, and not require desktop software or hardware, since not all clubs will have those resources.
  - ‚úÖ A Python workshop where the first step is to start a new Python project at [repl.it/languages/python](https://repl.it/languages/python)
  - ‚ùå A workshop on making an Android app that requires installing Android Studio
- Your Jam must be in English at native-level proficiency. 


**Wrapping up:**

This is a change to how we've done this before and if you have a great idea, we want to work closely with you to turn it into high quality content that clubs and individuals will use every day.

If you have any questions, please message in [#jams](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C058T2CJUNR) on Slack. We'll all be hanging out there to help out.
