# 3D Platformer Game With Godot Web-engine

### Details:
**_Task_** : To create a simple 3D platformer game using Godot's web based game engine

**_Requirements:_** : Any device with a browser

**_Language used:_** C#, GDScript

**_Customization opportunity:_** You can add your own assets and change the default cube player into a better asset like a human.

**_Platform Limitations:_** It works for all platforms with a browser

**_Time estimation:_** 1 Hour .

### Breakdown
- Setup: Making an account on Godot and starting a project! (5 mins)

- Part 2: Making scripts for player moments and collision detection. (25mins)
- Part 3: Adding a Jumping Mechanism. (10 mins)
- Success!!! You have made your first-ever game! (Note: Required time can vary from person to person, I have estimated and considered a beginner. For more skilled coders, it can even take less than the estimate)

### Questions:
1. How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e., how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)?
- Jammers can use their own assets that will make each jam visually different from the other. (Additionally, developers with more experience can even add animations.)
2. Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
- Come on, Who doesn't love games!?  
3. What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
- They will walk away with possibly their first-ever game and the knowledge to make more.  
4. What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
- Seeing the outcomes of your code in a virtual 3D world can be amusing for some beginners.  
5. What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
- Any platform with a browser
